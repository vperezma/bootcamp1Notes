##Goal for the day: Make sure everyone is on GitHub, understands the concept of floats and box models
+ 6:00 - 6:30 = Recap last week (Victor)
Recap on last week: See if the students looked further into github over the weekend or not. Make sure those that didn’t have a chance to get theirs working - get them working unless it was a version issue.

+ 8:30 - 8:45 = Questions
I want to always have a time for questions at the end of the class so that if there is something that we need to spend more time on (if it can’t be answered during that time) we can include it in the following day/week.

+ 8:45 - 9:00 = Wrap Up
I want to always have a wrap up time, that means going over EVERYTHING we talked about that day and what they can expect for the next day, what they should check out outside of class, weekend project, or what will be happening the following week when they return.
